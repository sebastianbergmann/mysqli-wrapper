# sebastian/mysqli-wrapper

This repository contains code that was originally written while building an example application for my
"[Event-Based Testing](https://thephp.cc/presentations/testable-database-interaction?ref=github)" presentation.

The code has been extracted from this example application into a reusable component. Just because
this component can be installed using Composer does not mean that it is anything  other than example
code. It is not production-ready. It is intended for study and learning purposes only.

The only reason this code was extracted into a reusable component is to make reusing it in other
example applications easier for me.

Please note that this is a [low maintenance project](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/mysqli-wrapper/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#low-maintenance-project).
